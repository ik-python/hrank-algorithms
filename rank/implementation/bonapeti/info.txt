TASK
Anna and Brian order N items at a restaurant, but Anna declines to eat any of the K^ih item (where 0 < k < n)
due to allergy.  When the check comes. they decide to split the cost of all the items they shared, however, Brian may have
forgotten that they did't split the k^ih item and accidently chrged Anna for it.

You are given N,K, the cost of each of the N items, and the total amount of money that Brian charged Anna for her position of the bill.
If the bill is fairly split, print Bon Appetit, otherwise, print the amount of money that Brian must refund Anna.
INPUT
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of N (the number of items ordered) and K
(the 0-based index of the item that Anna did not eat).
The second line contains N space-separated where each integer I denotes that cost, c|i| of item I (where 0 <= i <= n).
The third line contains an integer, Bcharged, denoting the amount of money that Brian charged Anna for her share of the bill.
CONSTANTS
2 <= n <= 10^5
0 <= k < n
0 <= c|i| <= 10 ^ 5
0 <= b <= Ec|i|
OUTPUT
