TASK
Consider an array of N integers, A = [a0, a1, .., aN-1]. The distance between two indices, i and j, is denoted
by dI,J = |i-j|.

Given A, find the minimum dI,J such, that aI=aJ and I != J. In other words, find the miminum distance between any pair of equal
elements in the array. If no such value exists, print -1.
Note: |a| denotes the absolute value of a.
INPUT
The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the size of array A.
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing the respective elements in array A.
CONSTANTS
1 <= N <= 10 ^ 3
1 <= aI <= 10 ^ 5
OUTPUT
Print a signle integer denoting the minimum dI,J in A; if no such value exists, print -1.
SAMPLE INPUT
6
7 1 3 4 1 7
SAMPLE OUTPUT
2
EXPLANATION
Here, we have two options:
a1 and a4 are both 1, so d1,4 = |1-4| = 3
a0 and a5 are both 7, so d0,5 = |0-5| = 5
The answer is min(3,5) = 3
