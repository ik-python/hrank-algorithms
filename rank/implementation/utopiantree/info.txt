TASK
The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its
height increases by 1 meter.
Laura plants Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after N growth cycles?
INPUT
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
T subsequent lines each contain an integer, N, denoting the number of cycles for that test case.
CONSTANTS
1 <= T <= 10
0 <= N <= 60
OUTPUT
For each test case, print the height of the Utopian Tree after N cycles. Each height must be printed on a new line.
SAMPLE INPUT
3
0
1
4
SAMPLE OUTPUT
1
2
7
EXPLANATION
There are 3 test cases.
In the first case (N=0), the initial height (H=1) of the tree remains unchained.
In the secons case (N=1) the initial height doubles in height and is 2 meters tall after the spring cycle.
In the third case (N=4), the tree doubles its height in spring (H=2), then grows a meter in summer (H=3), then doubles
after the next spring (H=6), and grows another meter after summer (H=7). Thus, at the end of 4 cycles, its height is 7 meters.
