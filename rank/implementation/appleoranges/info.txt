TASK
 Sam's house has an apple tree and an orange tre that yeld an abundance of fruit. In the diagram below, the red region denotes
his house, where s is the start point and t is the end point. The apple tree is to the left of his house, and the orange
tree is to its right. You can assume the trees are located on as single point, where the apple tree is at point a and the orange
tree is at point b.
 When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands d units of distance from its tree of oritin along th X-axis. A negative value of D means
the fruit fell D units to the tree's left, and a positive value of D means it falls D units to trhe tree's right.
 Given the value of D for M apples and N oranges, con you determine how many applyes and oranges will fall on Sam's house (in the
inclusive range |S,T|)? Print the number of apples that fall on Sam's house as you first line of output, then print the number of
oranges tat fall on Sam's house as your second line of output.
INPUT
The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of S and T.
The second line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of A and B.
The third line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of M and N.
The fourth line contains M space- separated integers denoting the respective distanes that each apple falls from point A.
The fifth line contains N space-separated integers denoting the respecrive distances that each orange fals from point B.
CONSTANTS
1 <= s,t,a,b,m,n <= 10 ** 5
-10^5 <= D <= 10^5
A < S < T < B
OUTPUT
Print two lines of output
1. On the first line, print the nubmer of apples that fall on Sam's house.
2. On the second line, print the number of oranges that fall on Sam's house.
