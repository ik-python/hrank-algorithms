TASK
HackerLand Enterpise is adopting a new viral advertising strategy. When the launch a new product, theq advertise it to exactly
5 people on social media.

On the first day, half of those 5 people (floor(5/2) = 2) like the advertisement and each person shares it with 3 of their friends;
the remaining people (5 - floor(5/2) = 3) delete the advertisement because it doesn't interest them. So, at the beginning of the second
day, floor(5/2) * 3 = 2 * 3 = 6 people receive advertisement.

On the second day, half of the 6 people who received the advertisement share it with 3 new friends. So, at the beginning of the second
day, floor(6/2) * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9 people receive the advertisement. The diagram below depicts the advertisement's virality over
the first three days(green denotes a person that likes the advertisement and red denotes a person that disliked and delete it):
