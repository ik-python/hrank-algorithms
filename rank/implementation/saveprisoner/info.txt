TASK
A jail has N prisoners, and each prisoner has a unique id number, S, ranging from, S, ranging from 1 to N. There are M sweets
that must be distributed to the prisoners.
The jailer decides the fairest way to do this is by sitting the prisoners down in a circlen and then, starting with some ranom S,
disttribute one candy at a time to each sequentially numbered prisoner untill all M candies are distributed. For example, if the
jailer picks prisoner S = 2, then his distribution order would be (2,3,4,5, .., n-1, 1, 2, 3, 4 ..) untill M sweets are distributed.

But wait - there's a catch - the very last sweet is poisoned! Can you find and print the ID number of the last prisoner to receive
a sweet so he can be warned?
INPUT
The first line contains an integer, T, denoting the number of test cases.
The T subsequent lines each contain 3 space-separated integers;
N (the number of prisoners), M (the number of sweets), and S(the prisoner ID), respectively
CONSTANTS
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 10^9
1 <= M <= 10^9
1 <= S <= 10^9
OUTPUT
For each test case, print the ID number of the prisoner who receives the poisoned sweet on a new line.
SAMPLE INPUT
1
5 2 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT
2
EXPLANATION
There are N = 5 prisoners and M = 2 sweets. Distribution startr at ID number S = 1, so prisoner 1 gets the first sweet and prisoner
2 gets the second sweet. Thus we must warn prisoner 2 about the poison, so we print 2 on a new line.
