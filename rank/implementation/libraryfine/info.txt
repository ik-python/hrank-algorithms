TASK
You local library needs you help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates
the fine(if any). The free structure is as follows.

1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charded
2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected
return date, fine = 15 Hackos * (the number of days late).
3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date,
the fine = 500 Hackos * (the number of days late).
4. If the book is returnd after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000 Hackos.
INPUT
The first line contains 3 space separated integers denoting the respective day, month, and year on which the book was actually
returned.
The second line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective day, month and year on which the book was expected to
be returned (due date)
CONSTANTS
1 <= D <= 31
1 <= M <= 12
1 <= Y <= 3000
It is guaranteed that the dates will be valid Gregorian calendar dates.
OUTPUT
Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.
