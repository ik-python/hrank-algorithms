TASK
You are given N sticks, where the lenght of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the
sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.

Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:
5 4 4 2 2 8

Then, in one cut opearation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. For the next cut opeartion four
sticks are left(of non-zero length), whose length are the following:
3 2 2 6
The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.
Given the length of N sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.
Note:for each cut opearation, you have to recalculate the length of smallest sticks(excluding zero-length sticks).
INPUT
The first line contains a single integer N.
The next line contains N integers a0, a1, ..., aN-1 separated by space, where aI represents the length of the iTh stick.
CONSTANTS
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= aI <= 1000
OUTPUT
For each operation, print the number of sticks taht are cut, on separate lines.
