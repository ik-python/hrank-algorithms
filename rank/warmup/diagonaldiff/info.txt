TASK
Given a square matrix of size NxN, calculate the absolute differenced between the sums of its diagonals.
INPUT
The first line contains a single integer, N. The next N lines denotes the matrix rows, with each line containing N space
separated integers describing the columns.
CONSTANTS
-----
OUTPUT
Print the absolute difference between the two sums of the matrix's  diagonals as a signle integer.
SAMPLE INPUT
3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
SAMPLE OUTPUT
15
EXPLANATION
The primary diagonal is:
11
      5
            -12

Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:
            4
      5
10
Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15
