TASK
Perform an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers, [a1, a2, ..., an-1]. After performing one right
circular operation, the array is transformed from [a0, a1, .., an-1] to [an-1, a0, .., an-2].

Perfrom this operation K times. To test this ability, to identify current element at a particular position in the rotated array,
asks Q queries, where each query consists of a single integer, M, for which you must print the element at index M in the rotated array.
INPUT
The first line  contains 3 space-separated integers, N, K and Q, respectively.
The second line contains N space-separated array of integers I describes array element A
Each of the Q subsequent lines contains a single integer denoting m
CONSTANTS
-----
OUTPUT
For each query, print the value of the element index M of the rotated array on a new line.
