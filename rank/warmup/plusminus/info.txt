TASK
Given an array of integers, calculate which fraction of its elements are positive, which fraction of its elements are
negative, and which fraction of its elements are zeros, respectively. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line.

Note: This challange introduces precision problems. The test case are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute
error of up to 10 ** -4 are acceptable.
INPUT
The first line contains an integer N, denoting the size of the array.
The second line contains N space separated integers describing an array of numbers (a0, a1, ..., an-1)
CONSTANTS
-----
OUTPUT
You must print the following 3 lines
1. A decimal representing of the fraction of positive numbers in the array.
2. A decimal representing of the fraction of negative numbers in the arrya.
3. A decimal representing of the fraction of zeros in the array.
SAMPLE INPUT
6
-4 3 -9 0 4 1
SAMPLE OUTPUT
0.500000
0.333333
0.166667
EXPLANATION
There are 3 positive numbers, 2 negative numbers, and 1 zero in the array.
The respective fractions of positive numbers, negative numbers ans zeros are 3/6=0.500000, 2/6=0.333333
and 1/6 = 0.166667, respectively
