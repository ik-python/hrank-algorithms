TASK
One day we have to distribute some chocolate to the colleagues. Need to make sure we cant distribute  the
chocolate unequaly. One of the program managers gets to know this and orders co make sure everyone gets equal
number of chocolates.

But to make things difficult for the intern, order is equalize for every colleague in the following manner.

For every operation, we can choose one of her colleagues and can do one of the three things.
1. Can give one chocolate to every colleague other than chosen one.
2. Can give two chocolates to every colleague other that chosen one.
3. Can give five chocolates to every colleague othe that chosen one

Calculate minimum number of such operations needed to ensure that every colleague has the same number of chocolates.
INPUT
First line contains an integer T detoting the number of test cases, T testecases follow.
Each testcase has 2 lines. First line of each testcase contains an integer N denoting the number of co-interns.
Second line contains N space separated integers denoting the current number of chocolates each colleague has.
CONSTANTS
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000
Number of initial chocolates each colleague has < 1000
OUTPUT
T lines each containing the minimum number of opearations needed to make sure all colleagues have the same number of chocolates.

EXPLANATION
1st operation: Dude increases all elements by 1 except 3rd one
2 2 3 7 > 3 3 3 8
2nd operation: Dude increases all element by 5 except last one
3 3 3 8 > 8 8 8 8
