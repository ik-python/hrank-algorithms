TASK
Watson gives Sherlock an array A of length n. Thne he asks hit to determine if there exists an element in the array such that the
sum of the elements on its left is equal to the sum of the elements on its right. If there are no elements to the right/left, then
the sum is considered to be zero.
Formally, find an I, such that a0 + a1 + ... + Ai-1 = Ai+1 + .. + An-1
INPUT
The first line contains T, the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains N, the number of elements in the array
A, the second line for each test case contains N space-separated integers, denoting the array A.
CONSTANTS
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A <= 2 * 10 ^ 4
1 <= i <= N
OUTPUT
For each test case print YES if there exists an element in the array, such, that the sum of the elements on its left is equal to the
sum of the elements on its right, othwerwise print NO.
