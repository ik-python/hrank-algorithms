TASK
The city of Gridland is represented as an N x M matrix where the rows are numbered from 1 to N and the columns are numbered from 1
to M.
Gridland has a network of train tracks that always run in straight horizontal lines along a row. In other words, the start and
end points of a train track are (r, c1) and (r, c2), where R represents the row number, c1 represents the starting column and
c2 represent the ending column of the train track.
The mayor of Gridland is surveing the city to determine the number of locations where lampposts can be placed. A lampost can be placed
in any cell that is not occupied by a train track.
Given a map of Gridland and its K train tracks, find and print the number of cells where the mayour can place lamposts.
Note: A train track may or may not overlap other train tracks within the same row.
INPUT
The first line contains three space separated integers describing the respective values of N (the number of rows), M (the number of
columns) and K(the number of train tracks).
Each line I of the K subsequent lines contains three space separated integers describing the respective values of r, c1 and c2 that
define a train track.
CONSTANTS
1 <= N, M <= 10 * 9
0 <= K <= 1000
1 <= R <= N
1 <= c1 <= c2 <= M
OUTPUT
Print a single integer denoting the number of cells where the mayour can install lampposts.
