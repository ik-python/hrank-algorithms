radio transmitters on the roofs of the city's houses. Each transmitter has a range, K, meaning it can transmit a signall to all houses

Given a map of Hackerland and the value K, can you find and print the minimum number of transmitters needed to cover every house in the city?
(Every house must be covered by at least one transmitter) Each transmitter be installed on top of an existing house.
INPUT
The first line containts two space-separated integers describing the respective values of n (the number of houses in Hackerland)
and K (the range of each transmitter)
The second line contains the N space-separated integers describing the respective locations of each house
CONSTANTS
1 <= N,K <= 10 ^ 5
1 <= X <= 10 ^ 5
There may be more that one house at the same location.
OUTPUT
Print a single integer denoting the minimum number of transmitters needed to cover all the houses.
